<!--Pseudocode starts here:

Start game: set wins=0, losses=0, guesses=10
Step 1: computer randomly assigns a letter to a variable.
Step 2: listen (wait) for user to press a key and record the key entry on event=keyup
Step 3: does the guess match the computer's variable?
	If yes, +1 to wins and reset game
	If no, -1 to guesses and add the guess to the list of letters guessed so far
Step 4: Is guesses remaining > 0?
	If yes, repeat process @ step 2
	If no, +1 to losses and reset game

Needed to reset the game:
	clear lettersGuessed array
	set guesses = 0
	pick an new letter
	leave wins and losses the same

tried turning the machinePick process into a function, and then calling it at the end of each round to pick a new letter, but that didn't work.  The new variable wasn't being stored outside of the function and so the variable "machinePick" was undefined when comparing it to the userPick.

Also tried removing the function and putting the machinePick code directly into the if statements, but it doesn't work there, probably because it's embedded in the onKeyHit funciton.

Consider trying a while loop.  Game logic was restored and game functions again, except reset.
